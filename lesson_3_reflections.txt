Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: I'd use remote repository, Whenever i'd:-
   1. Want to share final version or even beta verison for testing of project with friends and colleagues.
   2. Want to make a backup of the project somewhere else other than my local machine.
   3. Open for other developers so that they can play around with it and improve it.
