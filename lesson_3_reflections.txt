Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: I'd use remote repository, Whenever i'd:-
   1. Want to share final version or even beta verison for testing of project with friends and colleagues.
   2. Want to make a backup of the project somewhere else other than my local machine.
   3. Open for other developers so that they can play around with it and improve it.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Suppose i am working on a project with my friends and so whenever remote is updated by any of my co-workers, my git would also pull the
   same so instead of pulling each and every small update i'd prefer pulling manually after the whole project has been uploaded on remote.

   And sometimes if i want people to work on my project and update their modification to remote i wouldn't necessarily be wanting to implement
   those modification on my version which is on my local repository. Hence i prefer manual pulling than automatic.
